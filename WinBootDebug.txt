Booting a Windows machine into debugging mode using WinDbg (Windows Debugger) allows you to perform kernel-level debugging and diagnose system-level issues. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install WinDbg**: Ensure you have WinDbg installed on your debugging machine. You can download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) to get WinDbg.

2. **Connect Debugging Machine and Target Machine**:
   - You need two machines for this: the debugging machine and the target machine. The debugging machine runs WinDbg, while the target machine is the one you want to debug.
   - Make sure both machines are connected via a network connection, such as Ethernet.

3. **Configure Target Machine**:
   - On the target machine, open an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - Run the following command to configure the target machine to allow kernel debugging over a network connection:

   ```bash
   bcdedit /set debug on
   bcdedit /set debugtype serial
   bcdedit /set debugport 1
   bcdedit /set baudrate 115200
   ```

   - Reboot the target machine to apply the changes.

4. **Prepare Debugging Machine**:
   - On the debugging machine, open WinDbg.
   - Go to "File" > "Kernel Debug," or press `Ctrl+K`.

5. **Configure Network Debugging**:
   - In the "Kernel Debugging" dialog, set the "Host Pipe" or "TCP/IP" option based on your network configuration. If you're using Ethernet, you can use "TCP/IP."
   - Enter the IP address or machine name of the target machine.
   - Set the port number to the same port you specified in the `debugport` command on the target machine (usually 1).
   - Click "OK."

6. **Connect and Start Debugging**:
   - Click "File" > "Kernel Debug" again.
   - Select "Connect" to initiate the debugging session.

7. **Break into Debugging**:
   - Once the connection is established, you can press `Ctrl+Break` to break into the debugger, pause the target machine, and start debugging.

8. **Analyze and Debug**:
   - You can now use WinDbg to analyze kernel-level issues, set breakpoints, inspect memory, and perform various debugging tasks.

Please note that debugging a Windows kernel is an advanced and potentially risky task. Make sure you understand the implications and potential risks before attempting kernel debugging, especially on a production system.
